[I-C Attack: In-place and Cross-pixel Augmentations for Highly Transferable Transformation-based Attacks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3746027.3754799)

The paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025. This is the official implementation of I-C Attack.

**This repository provides the core transformation code for the I-C attack.** Integrating this code with a [transformation-based attack framework](https://github.com/Zhijin-Ge/TransferAttack/tree/main/transferattack/input_transformation) yieds the complete I-C attack.
